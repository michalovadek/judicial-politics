## Legal mobilization

-   What kinds of individuals and groups resort to litigation?

-   What influences the likelihood of interest group litigation and what makes their success likely?

## Legal mobilization

-   "invoking legal norms as a form of political activity by which the citizenry uses public authority on its own behalf" [@zemans1983]

-   the enforcement of the law often depends on private (non-governmental) actors

    -   traditionally in the US ("adversarial legalism"), possibly also in the EU [@kelemen2012]

## Adversarial vs bureaucratic legalism

-   law and policy in the US are strongly shaped by means of "lawyer-dominated **litigation**" [@kagan2003adversarial]

-   economic liberalization and political fragmentation in the EU has been argued to be leading Europe down the American path [@kelemen2012]

-   some private enforcement but role of state **bureaucracies** in implementation (centralized, hierarchical) remains strong in Europe – resistance to the US model [@foster2024]

## Legal mobilization

-   competing definitions but central is the use of law [@lehoucq2020]

-   "*the use of law in an explicit, self-conscious way through the invocation of a formal institutional mechanism*"

    -   comprises not only litigation but also e.g. amicus curiae briefs and legal petitions

    -   related to but distinct from *legal framing* and *legal consciousness*

## Why mobilize the law?

-   most often targeting **legal change** through courts ("strategic litigation")

-   raise rights consciousness and improve **receptivity** to claims

-   generate media **attention** and public support

## Why not?

-   fear of creating **negative precedents** entrenching unfavourable outcomes

-   change through courts lacks in **democratic** legitimation

-   fear of **backlash** against the pursued cause

    -   but other forms of policy change can also generate backlash [@keck2009]

## The drivers of legal mobilization

-   LM requires capacity to navigate a complex organizational field

-   actors need to have the necessary resources (financial, expertise) to take advantage of the available *legal opportunity structure* (LOS)

    -   but LOS is not just exogenously given, acting on it shapes it going forward [@vanhala2012]

## Legal opportunity structure (static)

-   legal **stock**

    -   what rights and laws are available to "hang" your case on?

-   **access** to justice

    -   who can access the procedure and under what conditions?

-   legal **costs**

    -   how expensive is it to access the procedure and is legal aid available?

## Legal opportunity structure (dynamic)

-   the text of a law is just the starting the point of law construction

    -   rules need to be interpreted in the process of being applied

-   actors attempt to mould LOS to their advantage by advancing new interpretations

    -   most commonly they are targeting judges but there are other options (e.g. MPs, ombudsmen)

    -   some might not see an opportunity where there is one [@vanderpas2024]

## Empirical examples

-   civil rights movements

    -   *Brown v Board of Education of Topeka* (1954)

    -   open LOS in US v closed LOS in NI [@defazio2012]

## Empirical examples

-   environmental movements [@vanhala2022]

    -   Aarhus Convention

    -   climate litigation [@setzer2019; @voeten2024]

## Empirical examples

-   LGBTQ+ movements [@keck2009]

    -   decriminalization, recognition, same-sex marriage

    -   international courts can help [@helfer2014]

    -   legalization of same-sex marriage reduces anti-gay bias [@kreitzer2014; @ofosu2019]

## Role of international law

-   chances are the LOS is in a stable equilibrium due to well-defined and entrenched preferences of the executive, legislature and courts

-   there is a huge literature on international law and courts disrupting such domestic equilibria and creating new opportunities for actors [@helfer2014; @simmons2009mobilizing; @alter2000; @pavone2019]

    -   domestic political players have less control over the international LOS

## Who litigates?  {.smaller}

-   until the 1930s, 90% of the SCOTUS docket was formed by business and property cases [@epp1998rights]

-   in the 1960s individual rights litigation at SCOTUS reached 70%

    -   most cases were sponsored by NGOs such as ACLU and NAACP

-   contrast with lack of success of Indian Supreme Court in the 1990s despite efforts to invite more rights cases

-   disagreement about the importance of the "support structure" [@sanchezurribarri2011; @epp2011]

## Who litigates?

-   the equalizing potential of the law is limited in practice by resource inequality [@galanter1974]

    -   financial resources buy (repeated) access to courts and better legal expertise (lawyers)

    -   repetition increases experience and therefore winning chances

-   more resourceful actors litigate more [@hofmann2021]

    -   but mixed evidence regarding proximity to power [@coglianese1996]

## Who wins?

-   those who litigate more are generally also more likely to win

-   individuals are the least likely to win cases in the US, followed by interest groups (heterogeneous) and governments

-   government lawyers often tend to be more successful than private lawyers

    -   e.g. the US Solicitor General's *certoriari* petitions to SCOTUS have a success rate of 70% compared to 3% for others [@chandler2011; @black2011; @bailey2005]

::: notes
role of US SG somewhat similar to role of the Commission in the EU system - also wins a lot and indicates what the pro-EU position is. But maybe COM and CJEU are more ideologically aligned
