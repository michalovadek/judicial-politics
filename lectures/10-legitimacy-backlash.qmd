## Assessment

-   before starting writing, make sure to:

    -   read the Assessment page on the website

    -   read the FAQ page on the website

    -   consult slides from week 7

## Legitimacy and public support

-   to what extent are courts immune from changes in public opinion?

-   is the legitimacy of judicial institutions in decline?

## Legitimacy

> Legitimacy is a psychological property of an authority, institution, or social arrangement that leads those connected to it to believe that it is appropriate, proper, and just. [@tyler2006]

-   sometimes used interchangeably with "authority" and "diffuse support"

    -   conceptually different from "specific support" (but measurement difficulties)

## Judicial legitimacy

-   unlike democratic parliaments and executives, most courts cannot derive their legitimacy from electoral mandates

-   at the same time, courts rely on diffuse support for effectiveness more than other branches

-   particularly important when constituents disagree over a policy decision

## Sources of judicial legitimacy

-   traditionally, belief in legalism and exposure to **legal symbols** is seen as a major source of judicial legitimacy [@gibson2017; @caldeira1992]

    -   legal symbols make individuals believe that what courts do is fairer and **different from politics**

    -   more awareness of courts leads to more exposure to its legitimizing symbols and a build up of a "repository of goodwill"

    -   legalistic (compared to partisan) framing of a ruling induces specific support [@magalhães2023]

## Sources of judicial legitimacy

-   @bartels2013 put forward an **ideological** explanation for judicial legitimacy

    -   individuals who believe they are in an ideological disagreement with SCOTUS ascribe it lower legitimacy than those who think they are in agreement

    -   individual perceptions of a court's ideological tenor can be quite variable (lack of awareness, obscured by legalism, etc.)

    -   perceived ideological congruence matters less for people who think courts decide on a case-by-case basis

## Sources of judicial legitimacy

-   seemingly even controversial decisions such as *Bush v. Gore* did not significantly reduce diffuse support for SCOTUS [@gibson2024]

-   ... that is until *Dobbs* [@levendusky2024]

## Support for SCOTUS post-*Dobbs*

## Political foundations  {.smaller}

-   we would expect that individuals holding **democratic values** are more supportive of judicial independence

    -   @bartels2023 find no evidence of this in the context of 2017 Kenyan elections

    -   @cheruvu2025 find less support for anti-court backlash among more democratically minded Hungarians

-   a study of 34 African countries shows that presidential **co-partisanship decreases support** for horizontal judicial power and increases it for vertical [@bartels2020]

    -   support for courts depends on who is in power

## Political context  {.smaller}

-   in line with positivity theory, greater **awareness** of a court should be associated with more support for its independence [@gibson2014]

-   @gandur2025 show that this relationship is affected by the political context

    -   in Poland and Hungary, the perception of **executive influence** on courts creates even more demand for judicial independence than in US and Germany, but awareness alone does not

-   identification with anti-system parties may reduce trust in courts [@arzheimer2024]

## Anti-system parties

## Maintaining public support  {.smaller}

-   to maintain diffuse support, it is arguably in courts' long-term interests to stay ideologically **close to the median** voter

-   courts can offer compensation to the "losers" to increase acceptance [@gonzalez-ocantos2019]

-   courts might care less about maintaining public support when

    -   they are aligned with the executive (for enforcement)

    -   the public is not paying attention (but see @casillas2011)

    -   public opinion is less important (autocracies)

## Maintaining public support

## Court rulings and public opinion

-   court rulings can (de)legitimize a policy [@sternberg2022]
    -   they are most effective when the courts are trusted
    -   media framing affects the degree to which a ruling moves public opinion [@linos2016]

## Backlash

![Daily Mail re Brexit judgment in *Miller* (2016)](img/daily-mail-enemies.png)

## Backlash against courts

-   what drives **backlash** against international courts? [@madsen2022]

    -   probably the same thing that drives backlash against domestic courts: disagreement with outcomes

    -   populism is at best a partial explanation [@voeten2020]

-   individual-level illiberal views about justice are negatively correlated with trust in the EU, ECtHR and domestic judiciaries [@voeten2022]

## Backlash against courts

-   evidence of greater **self-restraint** in response to backlash

    -   the ECtHR rules less often against most critical governments [@stiansen2018]

    -   the ECtHR restricted the scope of human rights and increased governments' margin of appreciation (discretion) [@helfer2020]
