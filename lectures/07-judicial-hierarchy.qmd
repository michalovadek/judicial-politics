## Assessment  {.smaller}

-   regular deadline: **29 April 2025**

-   what **theory** do you want to contribute to with your empirical analysis?

    -   derive a specific **hypothesis** from theoretical discussion

-   what **data** are you going to use to test your hypothesis?

-   what **method** are you going to use to analyse your data?

-   come to office hours after 2nd seminar if you want to chat about your paper idea

## Empirical paper  {.smaller}

-   **Introduction**: what is the research puzzle/problem and why is it important?

-   **Literature review**: what we already know about the problem from previous research and what gap is going to be addressed by your paper

    -   examples of a gap: all evidence comes from a single jurisdiction; there is conflicting evidence; existing theories do not account for an important variable; etc.

-   **Theory**: a reasoned justification of your principal expectation (**hypothesis**) prior to conducting the empirical analysis; must be informed by existing literature

    -   what puzzle does your theory attempt to explain?

    -   example of a hypothesis: "The likelihood of \[Supreme Court\] review should initially decrease and then increase in ideological distance \[from the lower court\]."

    -   what is your explanatory (independent) variable? What is your outcome (dependent) variable?

## Empirical paper {.smaller}

-   **Data:** information used to produce evidence and test your hypothesis

    -   which cases will offer leverage on your research problem?

    -   how do you operationalize your theory (variables) in data? What is the unit of analysis?

    -   what measurement choices were made in the construction of the dataset?

    -   you can use an existing dataset or collect your own data

    -   even in qualitative research keep meticulous track of your sources

-   **Methods/research design**: the empirical strategy applied to your data in order to test your hypothesis

    -   how do you analyse your data?

    -   what valid inferences can be made based on your method? e.g. average treatment effects vs mechanistic evidence

    -   what are the assumptions and limitations of the method?

## Empirical paper {.smaller}

-   **Findings and discussion**: the results produced by your empirical strategy and data

    -   what are the results of your analysis?

    -   what are the implications for your hypothesis? is there evidence in support or against it?

    -   what are the implications for the broader theory and literature?

    -   what have we learned that we did not know before?

-   **Conclusion**: summarize findings, highlight main contribution and limitations, and offer thoughts on policy and future research avenues

## Organizing the judiciary

-   how are judiciaries organized?

-   what are the implications of organizational principles for judicial decision-making?

## Judicial hierarchy

-   virtually all judiciaries around the world are organized hierarchically

-   three "layers" are typical

    -   supreme and constitutional (peak) courts at the top

    -   courts of appeal in the middle

    -   ordinary (lower) courts at the bottom

## Judicial hierarchy

-   peak courts = courts of final instance

    -   no more appeals possible

    -   of special significance in some jurisdictions (e.g. ECtHR)

-   in many systems there are multiple hierarchies

    -   e.g. military courts or administrative law (France)

## Judicial hierarchy

![](img/france-courts.png)

## Judicial hierarchy

-   in some circumstances, judicial hierarchies are not universally accepted

    -   in the EU, the CJEU proclaims the doctrine of supremacy of EU law over national law and its own role as the ultimate arbiter of EU law questions

    -   from the CJEU's perspective, all national courts must follow its lead

    -   not all national courts accept that the CJEU sits atop the EU law hierarchy

## Judicial hierarchy  {.smaller}

> The Court of Justice of the European Union exceeds its judicial mandate, as determined by the functions conferred upon it in Article 19(1) second sentence of the Treaty on European Union, where an interpretation of the Treaties is not comprehensible and must thus be considered arbitrary from an objective perspective. **If the Court of Justice of the European Union crosses that limit**, its decisions are no longer covered by Article 19(1) second sentence of the Treaty on European Union in conjunction with the domestic Act of Approval; at least in relation to Germany, these decisions lack the minimum of democratic legitimation necessary under Article 23(1) second sentence in conjunction with Article 20(1) and (2) and Article 79(3) of the Basic Law.

German Constitutional Court, Judgment of the Second Senate of 5 May 2020, press release

## Judicial hierarchy

-   judges at different levels of the pyramid face different pressures and incentives

    -   at the bottom, the range of goals is the widest (e.g. routines, workload, promotion, policy)

    -   at the top, judges are mostly concerned with policy considerations and ideological influence is therefore the strongest [@zorn2010]

## Judicial discipline

-   discipline in the judicial hierarchy is maintained through two mechanisms:

    -   precedents or rules created by higher courts to be followed by lower courts

    -   oversight by higher courts or the threat of reversing lower court decisions

## Role of precedent

-   even jurisdictions which do not formally subscribe to *stare decisis* usually employ precedents

-   precedents transmit rules through time and the judicial hierarchy

-   courts higher in the hierarchy and later in time can amend or expunge lower or previous precedents

## Role of lower courts  {.smaller}

-   in the standard account, lower courts implement the doctrines developed by peak courts

    -   they may try to make use of ambiguity to create room for their own preferences [@cameron2000]

    -   upper courts correct their "errors"

-   in the 'reversed' account, lower courts make their own doctrines [@carrubba2012]

    -   they have a first-mover advantage and are closer to case facts

    -   upper courts intervene when lower courts go too far

## The cost of review

-   upper courts do not have direct and immediate access to case facts, only to lower courts' decisions

    -   they need to spend time and resources to find out more

    -   =\> upper courts need to decide which decisions are worth auditing

-   upper courts care about lower courts' dispositions and rules

    -   lower courts choose rules to avoid review [@carrubba2012]

::: notes
the ideal situation for the lower court is one like the following:

suppose the lower court is liberal and wants a liberal rule. The Supreme Court is more conservative. The facts are such that the adoption of almost any rule would yield the disposition desired by the SC. But the lower court can push the rule further in its preferred direction because the "correct" disposition will to some extent shield it from review
:::

## The threat of reversal  {.smaller}

-   why do lower courts follow precedent? why do they fear reversal?

    -   reputation

    -   belief in legal principles [@cross2005]

    -   they want to have influence over the law [@carrubba2012]

-   interpersonal contacts between lower and appeal judges dampen the effect of ideological distance [@nelson2022]

    -   when the lower and appeal judges work in the same courthouse, ideological distance becomes irrelevant

## The threat of reversal

-   appeal courts pick up on signals ("fire alarms" / whistleblowing) about whether a decision is worth reviewing

    -   litigants filing appeals

    -   interest groups filing amici curiae briefs

    -   lower court judges dissenting [@beim2014]

::: notes
if the whistle is blown too often, the signal becomes less informative and easier to ignore for the lower court, leading to lower compliance with upper court doctrine
:::

## Collegial courts

-   most important courts are collegial – they involve bargaining between multiple judges

-   if opinion amendments by judges are costless, the result will align with the median judge's preferences

    -   if they are not, the opinion writer can pull the judgment slightly away from the median judge

## Collegial courts

-   judges are affected by the ideology, gender and race of the judges they co-decide with [@kastellec2013]

-   judges' mutual familiarity fosters openness and more extensive deliberation [@swalve2022]

## Role of chambers

-   to increase efficiency, courts can create chambers consisting of sub-groups of judges

-   their composition can be more or less permanent and stable

-   but they undermine the court's consistency in applying rules [@fjelstul2023]

## Case assignment

-   who decides who decides?

-   in some courts (e.g. CJEU), the president chooses the opinion writer (judge-rapporteur)

    -   a source of power to steer decisions in a desired direction

    -   at SCOTUS, the initial majority also gets the pen-holder [@lax2007]

-   automatic systems of random case assignment as an anti-corruption measure [@marcondes2019]

## Role of clerks

-   judges do not work alone – they are assisted by law clerks

    -   their influence can be considerable and their selection is not random [@badas2024]

-   judges, similar to politicians have different styles

    -   some are more willing to trust and delegate work than others
