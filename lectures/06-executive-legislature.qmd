## Strategic interactions

-   How do courts, executives and legislatures interact in the enactment and enforcement of policy?

-   How does strategic anticipation of mutual preferences affect how they behave?

## Separation of powers

-   even in systems where judicial independence is strong, there are many points of contact between the judiciary, the legislature and the executive

    -   appointment of judges

    -   competence disputes

    -   judicial review of adminstrative acts

    -   judicial review of statutory law

## Judicial review

-   constitutional (and sometimes ordinary) courts have in many jurisdictions the power of judicial review

-   the legislating body knows its acts can be reviewed

-   courts depend on the executive branch for enforcement

    -   public support for courts makes enforcement more likely

## Anticipating judicial review

-   in general, legislators want to avoid having their laws struck down by judges

-   what is the chance the act will be **reviewed**?

    -   shaped by rules on jurisdiction and judicial review

-   what is the chance the act will be **overturned**?

    -   shaped by distance between legislator and court

## Anticipating judicial review

-   the legislature only needs to fear the courts when judicial review is likely to happen

-   in some countries this is virtually guaranteed (e.g. US), while elsewhere there will be more uncertainty

    -   in the EU, if all political actors agree, there is very low chance of review

    -   the possibility of judicial review can be endogenous to policy making [@pavone2022]

## Anticipating judicial review

-   the legislature only needs to fear the courts when they prefer to overturn an act

-   the legislature will look for information on:

    -   the court's previous case law

    -   judges' ideological distance

    -   public support

## Anticipating judicial review

-   in reality, no actor has complete and perfect information about the judicial review game

    -   there is **uncertainty** about how the courts will react

    -   actors sometimes behave irrationally

-   the legislator might water down an act or otherwise pre-empt negative judicial action

## Anticipating judicial review

-   in some cases, the legislator will not shy away from judicial conflict [@schroeder2022]

    -   when they have strong public support [@vanberg2001; @krehbiel2016]

    -   when they signal intention to not comply

## Anticipating reactions

-   courts have also reasons to fear confrontation

    -   **non-compliance** undermines their power and legitimacy

    -   may trigger **court curbing** by the other branches

    -   just like legislatures do not want to be censored by courts, courts do not want to be **overridden** by legislatures

## (Non-)Compliance

-   due to courts' enforcement-dependency, non-compliance is an attractive strategy for other actors (especially other branches of power)

    -   but non-compliance can itself generate more litigation

-   in most cases it is less costly for the government/legislator to evade compliance implicitly

    -   e.g. creating a parliamentary working group but never delivering [@vanberg2001]

## Threat of override

-   courts may also take into account whether their decision is likely to be overridden by the legislature [@meernik1997; @larsson2021]

    -   though the empirical evidence of override anticipation by courts is mixed [@segal1997; @segal2010]

-   courts are looking for judgments which are as close as possible to their ideal point but not so far as to get overridden

## Threat of override

## Court curbing

-   the legislator signalling intent to engage in court curbing is likely to lead to judicial self-restraint

-   a number of possible measures:

    -   budget and staffing cuts

    -   induced judicial exits (e.g. lowering retirement age)

    -   court expansion and packing

    -   limiting jurisdiction and powers

## The constrained court

-   fear of negative repercussions leads to self-censoring by courts

-   courts are on safer ground when they support popular policies

    -   leads to the notion of "judicial majoritarianism" [@hall2015]

## The friendly court

-   consistent with the idea of the majoritarian court is evidence of courts ruling against policies of previous governments [@segal2010; @gillman2002]

    -   a "friendly" judicial intervention can be particularly valuable when it concerns constitutional interpretation that would be otherwise difficult to legislate away (e.g. *Roe* and *Dobbs*)

    -   also helps explain why governments might sometimes appear to support "activist" judiciaries [@whittington2005]
