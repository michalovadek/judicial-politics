## Controlling the judiciary

-   how do politicians keep tabs on judges?

-   how do they ensure that delegation of judicial power does not go beyond what they originally envisaged?

-   how do judges govern themselves?

## *Ex ante* and *ex post* control

-   we can generally divide tools of political control in two categories [@helfer2005]

    -   *ex ante*: mechanisms of control designed prior to the court's operation

    -   *ex post*: mechanisms of control developed in response to the court's operation

## Jurisdiction

-   a key decision liable to influence how much and over what types of issues a court has power concerns **jurisdiction** (or access / standing / *locus standi*)

-   jurisdiction is abour regulating access to courts

    -   in general, the more actors can access a court, the greater its power

## Defining jurisdiction

-   there are multiple ways of defining (= constraining) a court's jurisdiction and usually more than one is used at once

    -   geographical (e.g. US Courts of Appeals)

    -   substantive (e.g. UK Supreme Court re Scottish criminal law)

    -   personal (e.g. ECJ rules on standing)

## Jurisdiction (geography)

![There are differences across geographical boundaries. For example, some US Courts of Appeal are more liberal than others [@broscheid2011]](img/us-map-appeals.png)

## Jurisdiction (substantive)

-   it is common for higher courts to be able to rule on "points of law only"

    -   they (and the litigants) are confined to dealing with the facts as established by lower courts

-   many countries create specialized courts to deal with some branches of law

    -   arguable boundaries invite "forum shopping"

## Jurisdiction (personal)

-   the CJEU has famously restrictive access rules for private litigants

> Any natural or legal person may \[...\] institute proceedings against an act **addressed to that person** or which is of **direct** and **individual** **concern** to them, and against a regulatory act which is of direct concern to them and does not entail implementing measures.

## Appointment procedures

-   the most salient *ex ante* mechanism

-   the institutional designer and appointer balance their preferences for judicial independence and accountability [@dunoff2017]

-   there is considerable variety in how judges are appointed around the world

## Variation in appointment procedures

```{r appointvar}

# data from Oxf handbook
comp <- tribble(
  ~dominant, ~n,
  "executive", 46,
  "legislature", 17,
  "courts", 1,
  "mixed", 72,
  "council", 76
)

# plot
comp |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = reorder(dominant, n))) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Number of courts", y = "Dominant influence in selection",
       caption = "Based on Tiede (2024)")
```

## Appointment procedures {.smaller}

-   mixed systems encourage a tendency for each appointing branch to select judges most closely aligned with its interests

    -   this cleavage may supersede partisan preferences [@tiede2020; @brasheartiede2024]

-   mixed systems can hinder the functioning of collegial courts

    -   but greater diversity can also improve the quality of decisions

-   more veto players =\> more moderate judges

## Judicial councils

-   institutional vehicle for judicial self-governance

-   in charge of appointing judges, managing budgets, promotions and discipline

-   strongly promoted by international organizations in the 2000s

-   trade-off between insulation and external accountability [@garoupa2009]

::: notes
talk about composition:

-   are judges dominant? peak or ordinary?

-   who else appoints members?
:::

## Tenure

-   the tenure of judges can differ markedly by country and type of court

    -   most ordinary judges are appointed for life, sometimes with age limits

    -   judges on constitutional and international courts are often term-bound and can sometimes be reappointed

::: notes
UK Supreme Court has mandatory retirement at 75

ICJ judges have 9-year tenure

ECtHR judges had their tenures increased from 6 to 9 but made non-renewable
:::

## Reappointment

-   the prospect of **reappointment** influences judicial behaviour [@hall2014; @stiansen2022]

    -   judges who are up for reappointment are more responsive to the preferences of their principal

-   non-renewable terms can however damage a court's effectiveness

    -   turnover can affect retention of expertise

## Transparency

-   the principals' ability to monitor (and therefore punish/reward) judicial behaviour is conditional on **transparency**

-   while decisions are always public, individual votes and dissents are not

-   do principals have other means of obtaining information about the voting of judges?

## Renewal and transparency

|                            |                      |                       |
|----------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
|                            | **Low transparency** | **High transparency** |
| *Life tenure*              | Low incentive        | Low incentive         |
| *Renewable fixed term*     | Low incentive        | High incentive        |
| *Non-renewable fixed term* | Low incentive        | Low incentive         |

: Interaction of renewal opportunities and transparency for judges' incentives to appease principals

## Judicial exits

-   judges are rarely forced out of office through removal procedures

    -   court curbing governments prefer lowering the mandatory retirement age (e.g. Hungary in 2012, Poland in 2017, El Salvador in 2021)

-   the motivations behind a judge quitting can be more varied however

## Strategic retirements {.smaller}

-   hypothesis: federal judges in the US prefer to retire under presidents of the same political party that first appointed them [@stolzenberg2022; @nixon2000]

    -   @stolzenberg2022 argue that this behaviour is driven more by reciprocity norms (giving back to appointing party) than ideology

    -   in contrast, @deschler2024 show that recently, moderate Republican judges have withheld retirement under more conservative presidents such as Trump (ideology \> partisanship/reciprocity)

-   older judges are more inclined to retire strategically [@hansford2010]

-   understudied outside the US [@pérez-liñán2017]

## Judicial elections

-   perceived rejection of "elite-driven" judicial selection

-   tried out in revolutionary France (1790) and Central America post Spanish independence

-   38 US states (as of 2024) elect judges to state supreme courts [@lim2013; @lim2015; @besley2013]

    -   the 2023 Wisconsin Supreme Court election saw 51 million USD in campaign spending

::: notes
the Wisconsin figure is only slightly less than total party spending in the 2019 UK general election. Wisconsin has a population of less than 6 million (cf UK almost 70)
:::

## Judicial elections {.smaller}

-   @driscoll2015 show the impact of Bolivia introducing judicial elections

    -   judges became much more diverse as a result (in contrast to the US)

    -   confidence in the judiciary increased among government supporters but declined overall

-   Mexico has been holding judicial elections for a portion of offices since 2025

    -   pre-selected candidates by evaluation committees of each branch of government

    -   mired in disagreement and controversy

::: notes
the judicial branch has been refusing to cooperate after a judge ruled to suspend the election
