## How do judges make decisions?

-   last week we spoke about the main theoretical approaches to understanding judicial behaviour

-   this week we continue with this theme by looking at judicial preferences in more detail

## Variation in judicial preferences

-   some judges are more ...

    -   ideological, partisan, competent, power-hungry, lazy, independent, ambitious, etc.

... than others

-   the sources of judicial preferences are manifold: background characteristics, experience, legal and political context

## Variation in judicial preferences

-   if judges were randomly sampled from a country's population, their preferences would be on average (in expectation) similar to the population's

    -   there would also be a lot of heterogeneity (as much as in the population)

-   in reality, judicial preferences are **systematically** influenced by a set of institutional factors

## Systematic variation in judicial preferences

-   what needed to happen for someone to become a judge on court X? (**selection effects**)

    -   what kind of person wants to become a legal professional? (*internal*)

    -   what kind of person is likely to be appointed a judge? (*external*)

-   answers to these questions will be shaped by institutional features

## Gender variation on the bench

-   judges' gender systematically influences judicial preferences, at least for some types of cases

-   the proportion of female judges varies greatly between countries

    -   around 30% in common law countries

    -   over 70% in some post-socialist countries

## Women in the Czech judiciary {.smaller}

-   @havelková2022 illustrate the impact of institutional factors on gender representation in the Czech judiciary

-   low importance and prestige under socialism resulted in many female judges (60+%)

    -   low salary (relative to lawyers) perpetuate the inequality post-socialism

    -   standard working hours (relative to lawyers) attract more women due to childcare

-   despite higher overall numbers, the most important positions are occupied by men

    -   the childcare penalty hampers career progression but female judges largely accept their situation as given [@urbániková2024]

## Realizing judicial preferences

-   judicial preferences manifest most importantly in decisions

-   judges' ability to realize their preferences is to varying degrees constrained by: the facts of the case, the law, preferences of other deciding judges (panel decisions), preferences of other actors (e.g. the legislature)

## Realizing judicial preferences

-   a common objection to non-legal analyses of judicial behaviour is that disagreement between judges (or courts) is misrepresented as ideological

-   if this objection holds, disagreements about the law should not correlate with disagreements about policy

    -   but e.g. almost all proponents of originalist interpretation of the US constitution also prefer conservative policies

## Empirical evidence

-   US Courts of Appeals judges apply different standards in comparable capital punishment cases depending on whether they were appointed by D or R president [@beim2021]

-   a law and economics training programme for US judges made them decide more conservatively [@ash2022]

-   Fox News viewership causes elected judges to impose harsher sentences [@ash2024]

## Learning about judicial preferences

-   one of the most challenging tasks in the study of judicial behaviour is **measuring** judicial preferences

-   judges operate much more secretively than politicians and are therefore more difficult to approach (for interviews, surveys, experiments)

-   even if we could ask judges about their preferences, it is unlikely they would answer sincerely (**social desirability bias**)

## Learning about judicial preferences

-   the most common way of learning about judicial preferences is by looking at what judges decide

    -   **pros**: real behaviour (vs experimental hypotheticals); revealed (vs stated) preferences

    -   **cons**: "post-treatment"; motivated reasoning; requires individual positions (on panels); comparability requires random case assignment

## The case space model

![](img/case-space-1.png)

-   imagine a one-dimensional space mapping countries by how dangerous they are to live in

## The case space model

![](img/case-space-2.png)

-   imagine each case concerns an asylum application from a different country of origin

## The case space model

![](img/case-space-3.png)

## The case space model

![](img/case-space-4.png)

-   the judge prefers to **grant** all applications to the left of their ideal point

## The case space model

![](img/case-space-5.png)

-   the judge prefers to **deny** all applications to the right of their ideal point

## The case space model

## The case space model

-   which judge is the most conservative?

-   which judge is the median judge?

## Ideal point estimation

-   aggregating judicial preferences from decisions is not as straightforward as taking the average of yes/no votes

-   a vote in favour of the plaintiff might be associated with both ends of the policy spectrum

-   not all cases are equally "difficult" to decide for a judge

## Ideal point estimation

-   scholars have therefore adapted item-response theory models from psychometrics to solve these issues [@bafumi2005]

-   there are generally three parameters in these models:

    -   the judge's ideal point ($\theta_j$) or "ability"

    -   the case's location or "difficulty" ($\alpha_i$)

    -   the case's discrimination sensitivity ($\gamma_i$)

## Ideal point estimation  {.smaller}

-   a judge's response $y_{ij}$ (vote/decision) in a case is modelled as the distance between their ideal point and the case's location on a continuum (e.g. left-right)

$$
Pr(y_{ij}) = \frac{exp(-\alpha_i + \gamma_i \theta_j)}{1 - exp(-\alpha_i + \gamma_i \theta_j)}
$$

-   the discrimination parameter $\gamma_i$ reflects how strongly the case's response probabilities are influenced by small changes in the distance between the judge's ideal point and the case's location

    -   high $\gamma_i$ : the case is more sensitive to the distance and provides sharp differentiation (e.g. a polarizing case)

    -   low $\gamma_i$ : the case is less sensitive and provides more gradual differentiation (e.g. a case unrelated to the latent dimension)

## Ideal point estimation

```{r idealsigma1}

generate_sigmoid <- function(alpha, gamma) {
  # Create a sequence of x values
  x <- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 100)
  
  # Define the sigmoid function
  sigmoid <- function(x) {
    1 / (1 + exp(-(gamma * (x - alpha))))
  }
  
  # Calculate y values using the sigmoid function
  y <- sigmoid(x)
  
  # Plot the sigmoid curve
  plot(x, y, type = "l", col = "blue", lwd = 2,
       xlab = "Latent dimension", ylab = "Probability of voting in favour",
       main = paste("Case (item) with α =", alpha, "and γ =", gamma))
  
  # Add a dashed line at y = 0.5
  abline(h = 0.5, lty = 2, col = "black")
  
  # Add a dashed vertical line where the sigmoid crosses y = 0.5
  abline(v = alpha, lty = 2, col = "black")
  
  # add judges
  points(x = 1, y = 1, col = "black", pch = 16)
  points(x = 0.5, y = 1, col = "black", pch = 16)
  points(x = -3, y = 0, col = "black", pch = 16)
  
}

# plot
generate_sigmoid(alpha = -1, gamma = 1)
```

## Ideal point estimation

```{r idealsigma2}
# plot
generate_sigmoid(alpha = 0.7, gamma = 3)
```

## Ideal point estimation

```{r idealsigma3}
# plot
generate_sigmoid(alpha = -1.3, gamma = -1)
```

## Ideal point estimation

-   the recovered dimension could in principle be anything

-   researchers need to validate it against additional information about cases and judges to establish what it captures (e.g. left-right)

## Panel aggregation paradox  {.smaller}

![](img/agg_paradox.png){width="500"}

-   @landa2009 highlight how aggregation of decisions on panels by majority might deviate from individual decisions on case components

-   if both considerations are absent, the decision should be upheld; judges decide by majority

-   there is evidence that judges who sit together on panels are capable of influencing each other [@grossman2016; @kastellec2013]
