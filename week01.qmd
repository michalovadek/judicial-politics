title: "1: Reasons for Courts"
---

What are courts and what is their purpose in society and politics? Mohr defines courts as

> a family of passive governmental institutions one of whose prominent functions is the settlement of disputes, distinguished from other governmental institutions by a commitment to decide impartially, after presentation of proofs and arguments by contending parties, and to be able to justify decisions according to pre-existing rule.[^1]

In this session we reflect on the intended functions of courts in societies, common typologies of courts and why they are relevant for the study of politics.
