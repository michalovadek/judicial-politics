title: "Methods resources"
---

In the course of this module we will be encountering a variety of empirical methods and research designs. Below is an indicative list of methodological resources offering a useful entry point to both qualitative and quantitative research designs. Consulting and translating into practice relevant methodological resources -- not constrained to the list below -- is particularly important for the [assessment](assessment.qmd#assessment-tips).
