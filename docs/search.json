    "text": "Description\nThis course provides a detailed exploration of judicial politics across a variety of political systems. As predominantly non-majoritarian institutions, both domestic and international courts have become increasingly contested in recent years. We will seek to understand the importance and behaviour of courts from different angles: judiciaries’ place in democratic theory, the design of judicial institutions, and judges’ interactions with other political actors and society more broadly. Among others, we will be delving into why and how politicians balance delegating decision-making to courts with constraining their room for manoeuvre through appointment procedures and threat of override. We will also compare the institutional features of judiciaries across different political contexts, from democracies to autocracies and from presidential to parliamentary systems. The aim is to equip students with a clear understanding of courts as both subjects and objects of their political environment.\n\n\n\nModule Name\nJudicial Politics\n\n\nModule Code\nPOLS0113\n\n\nModule Convenor\nDr Michal Ovádek\n\n\nFaculty\nSocial and Historical Sciences\n\n\nDepartment\nPolitical Science\n\n\nCredits\n15\n\n\nAssessment\n3000-word research paper (100%)",

The deadline and submission instructions for the assessment can be found on the module’s Moodle page.\nThe research paper must be empirical in nature. This means the research has to rely on observable evidence to answer a question about an aspect of judicial politics. The research design devised to answer the research question can be quantitative, qualitative or mixed.\nEach research paper must include one section discussing theory and one section discussing research design. The theory section sets out the researcher’s expectations about the studied phenomenon on the basis of existing academic literature and typically ends with a testable hypothesis. The research design section describes how the research question will be answered and must include a discussion of the information (data) and the method (e.g. process tracing or regression analysis) used to produce evidence in support of (or against) a hypothesis. Other sections are optional but “introduction” and “findings” (or equivalent) are encouraged to also feature in the paper.\nPapers are expected to use an author-year (in-text) citation system. Citation and reference formatting should follow the Chicago or Harvard style. The list of references at the end of the document are not counted towards the word limit (but the in-text citations are). Any footnotes or endnotes count towards the word limit. Compliance with university plagiarism policies is a must.\n\nGeneral assessment criteria\nThe markers will consider the following criteria when assessing your essay:\n\nStructure and organisation\nExtent of research work completed\nUse of evidence\nDevelopment and consistency of arguments\nEvidence of critical analysis\nOverall insight and originality\nAdequacy and presentation of bibliographic information\nAccuracy and appropriateness of referencing\nOverall presentation\n\nAn excellent essay will be strong on each criterion.\n\n\nUse of artificial intelligence tools\nNo part of the work submitted for assessment is allowed to have been generated or otherwise produced by artificial intelligence tools. Failure to abide by this requirement will be treated as academic misconduct and trigger the relevant procedures and penalties. Standard academic misconduct regulations apply at all times.",

    "text": "Presentations\nIn teaching weeks 2 to 10, student presentations are given on courts in a comparative perspective. These presentations are formative (not marked). Nonetheless, they play an important role in the module. They ensure that the class attains an overview of judicial politics across different national and international contexts. They also give the presenting students an opportunity to familiarize themselves with empirical research before the final paper.\nStudents present in groups of two with each student covering one specific court. The chosen courts should preferably hold high importance in the judicial system of a country or international organization (e.g. peak courts). The presenting group concludes the presentation with a comparison of the selected courts. The full presentation should take 25 minutes in total.\nTo enable a structured comparison of courts across different jurisdictions, each student chooses a specific court on which they collect and present answers to at least the following questions:\n\nAt which level of hierarchy does the court operate?\nHow many judges work at the court?\nHow are the judges appointed?\nWhat are the court’s resources? (e.g. its annual budget)\nDoes the court have discretion over which cases it decides? (i.e. docket control)\nHow many cases a year does the court decide on average?\nIs it possible to appeal the court’s decisions?\nAre judges’ votes public?\nDoes the court speak with a single voice or are dissents allowed?\nHow does the public view the court?\n\nIn the final part of the presentation, the presenting group should reflect on what we can learn about judicial politics based on the similarities and differences between the courts. For example, the group might want to consider the extent to which different appointment procedures manifest in different ideological compositions of a court (or any other aspect of judicial politics).\nThe groups and weeks are assigned in the seminar of week 1 on a first-come-first-serve basis.

The final paper for this module needs to be substantially different from any previously submitted work. If you are planning on reusing previous work, you must flag this to the instructor.\nAre the classes going to be recorded?\nNo.\nCan I record the video, image or sound of the classes on my own device?\nNo.\nAre the lecture slides available?\nYes. They can be found after the lecture on the week’s course page.\nIs class attendance compulsory?\nSeminar attendance is mandatory and monitored by the Department of Political Science. You need to tap your student card when entering the room to register attendance.\nCan I consult my choice of a topic for the final paper with the instructor?\nYes, during office hours.\nCan I ask questions about my paper idea after the term is over?\nNo. Consultations on paper ideas must take place during the ten teaching weeks.\nIs there a +-10% tolerance around the word count for the final paper?\nNo. The paper can be no longer than 3000 words, excluding the bibliography but including in-text citations.\nDo I have to use quantitative methods in the final paper?\nNo. Qualitative methods are equally admissible.\nCan I submit the final paper with an appendix?\nYes. Supplementary analyses – such as robustness checks – or evidence which would take up too much space in the paper – such as a long excerpt from a document – can be submitted in an appendix and referred to in the main text. The appendix does not count towards the 3000-word limit. All essential information must be included in the paper, however.",

In the text, Suen-nada and Ennum-Ashur accuse each other of stealing the valuable contents of a private archive which they both claim to own. Items within the archive include cylinder seals, tablets belonging to various named merchants, and tablets belonging to strangers that were deposited there for safe keeping. As undisturbed tablet storerooms are extremely rare, this text is important for reconstructing the contents of a sealed archive. Ennum-Assur calls for the case to be moved to Ashur to be tried in front of the city assembly and king, but unfortunately the verdict of the court is unknown."

From that, the obligation that the parties find in their daily polemics to borrow ideas and language from the judicial system. Since most public men are or have formerly been jurists, they make the habits and the turn of ideas that belong to jurists pass into the handling of public affairs. The jury ends up by familiarizing all classes with them. Thus, judicial language becomes, in a way, the common language; so the spirit of the jurist, born inside the schools and courtrooms, spreads little by little beyond their confines; it infiltrates all of society, so to speak; it descends to the lowest ranks, and the entire people finishes by acquiring a part of the habits and tastes of the magistrate.\nAlexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America (1835)"
