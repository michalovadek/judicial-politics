    "text": "Description\nThis course provides a detailed exploration of judicial politics across a variety of political systems. As predominantly non-majoritarian institutions, both domestic and international courts have become increasingly contested in recent years. We will seek to understand the importance and behaviour of courts from different angles: judiciaries’ place in democratic theory, the design of judicial institutions, and judges’ interactions with other political actors and society more broadly. Among others, we will be delving into why and how politicians balance delegating decision-making to courts with constraining their room for manoeuvre through appointment procedures and threat of override. We will also compare the institutional features of judiciaries across different political contexts, from democracies to autocracies and from presidential to parliamentary systems. The aim is to equip students with a clear understanding of courts as both subjects and objects of their political environment.\n\n\n\nModule Name\nJudicial Politics\n\n\nModule Code\nPOLS0113\n\n\nModule Convenor\nDr Michal Ovádek\n\n\nFaculty\nSocial and Historical Sciences\n\n\nDepartment\nPolitical Science\n\n\nCredits\n15\n\n\nAssessment\n3000-word research paper (100%)",

    "text": "The module is assessed by one compulsory research paper of 3000 words worth 100% of the final mark. The deadline and submission instructions for the assessment can be found on the module’s Moodle page.\nThe research paper must be empirical in nature. This means the research has to rely on observable evidence to answer a question about an aspect of judicial politics. The research design devised to answer the research question can be quantitative, qualitative or mixed.\nEach research paper must include one section discussing theory and one section discussing research design. The theory section sets out the researcher’s expectations about the studied phenomenon on the basis of existing academic literature and typically ends with a testable hypothesis. The research design section describes how the research question will be answered and must include a discussion of the information (data) and the method (e.g. process tracing or regression analysis) used to produce evidence in support of a hypothesis. Other sections are optional but “introduction” and “findings” (or equivalent) are encouraged to also feature in the paper.\nPapers are expected to use an author-year (in-text) citation system. Citation and reference formatting should follow the Chicago or Harvard style. The list of references at the end of the document are not counted towards the word limit (but the in-text citations are). Any footnotes or endnotes count towards the word limit. Compliance with university plagiarism policies is a must.\n\nGeneral assessment criteria\nThe markers will consider the following criteria when assessing your essay:\n\nStructure and organisation\nExtent of research work completed\nUse of evidence\nDevelopment and consistency of arguments\nEvidence of critical analysis\nOverall insight and originality\nAdequacy and presentation of bibliographic information\nAccuracy and appropriateness of referencing\nOverall presentation\n\nAn excellent essay will be strong on each criterion.\n\n\nUse of artificial intelligence tools\nNo part of the work submitted for assessment is allowed to have been generated or otherwise produced by artificial intelligence tools. Failure to abide by this requirement will be treated as academic misconduct and trigger the relevant procedures and penalties. Standard academic misconduct regulations apply at all times.",
