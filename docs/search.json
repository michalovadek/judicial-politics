    "text": "Description\nThis course provides a detailed exploration of judicial politics across a variety of political systems. As predominantly non-majoritarian institutions, both domestic and international courts have become increasingly contested in recent years. We will seek to understand the importance and behaviour of courts from different angles: judiciaries’ place in democratic theory, the design of judicial institutions, and judges’ interactions with other political actors and society more broadly. Among others, we will be delving into why and how politicians balance delegating decision-making to courts with constraining their room for manoeuvre through appointment procedures and threat of override. We will also compare the institutional features of judiciaries across different political contexts, from democracies to autocracies and from presidential to parliamentary systems. The aim is to equip students with a clear understanding of courts as both subjects and objects of their political environment.\n\n\n\nModule Name\nJudicial Politics\n\n\nModule Code\nPOLS0113\n\n\nModule Convenor\nDr Michal Ovádek\n\n\nFaculty\nSocial and Historical Sciences\n\n\nDepartment\nPolitical Science\n\n\nCredits\n15\n\n\nAssessment\n3000-word research paper (100%)",

The deadline and submission instructions for the assessment can be found on the module’s Moodle page.\nThe research paper must be empirical in nature. This means the research has to rely on observable evidence to answer a question about an aspect of judicial politics. The research design devised to answer the research question can be quantitative, qualitative or mixed.\nEach research paper must include one section discussing theory and one section discussing research design. The theory section sets out the researcher’s expectations about the studied phenomenon on the basis of existing academic literature and typically ends with a testable hypothesis. The research design section describes how the research question will be answered and must include a discussion of the information (data) and the method (e.g. process tracing or regression analysis) used to produce evidence in support of a hypothesis. Other sections are optional but “introduction” and “findings” (or equivalent) are encouraged to also feature in the paper.\nPapers are expected to use an author-year (in-text) citation system. Citation and reference formatting should follow the Chicago or Harvard style. The list of references at the end of the document are not counted towards the word limit (but the in-text citations are). Any footnotes or endnotes count towards the word limit. Compliance with university plagiarism policies is a must.\n\nGeneral assessment criteria\nThe markers will consider the following criteria when assessing your essay:\n\nStructure and organisation\nExtent of research work completed\nUse of evidence\nDevelopment and consistency of arguments\nEvidence of critical analysis\nOverall insight and originality\nAdequacy and presentation of bibliographic information\nAccuracy and appropriateness of referencing\nOverall presentation\n\nAn excellent essay will be strong on each criterion.\n\n\nUse of artificial intelligence tools\nNo part of the work submitted for assessment is allowed to have been generated or otherwise produced by artificial intelligence tools. Failure to abide by this requirement will be treated as academic misconduct and trigger the relevant procedures and penalties. Standard academic misconduct regulations apply at all times.",

    "text": "Presentations\nIn teaching weeks 2 to 10, student presentations are given on courts in a comparative perspective. These presentations are formative (not marked). Nonetheless, they play an important role in the module. They ensure that the class attains an overview of judicial politics across different national and international contexts. They also give the presenting students an opportunity to familiarize themselves with empirical research before the final paper.\nStudents present in groups of two with each student covering one specific court. The chosen courts should preferably hold high importance in the judicial system of a country or international organization (e.g. peak courts). The presenting group concludes the presentation with a comparison of the selected courts. The full presentation should take 25 minutes in total.\nTo enable a structured comparison of courts across different jurisdictions, each student chooses a specific court on which they collect and present answers to at least the following questions:\n\nAt which level of hierarchy does the court operate?\nHow many judges work at the court?\nHow are the judges appointed?\nWhat are the court’s resources? (e.g. its annual budget)\nDoes the court have discretion over which cases it decides? (i.e. docket control)\nIs it possible to appeal the court’s decisions?\nAre judges’ votes public?\nDoes the court speak with a single voice or are dissents allowed?\nHow does the public view the court?\n\nIn the final part of the presentation, the presenting group should reflect on what we can learn about judicial politics based on the similarities and differences between the courts. For example, the group might want to consider the extent to which different appointment procedures manifest in different ideological compositions of a court (or any other aspect of judicial politics).\nThe groups and weeks are assigned in the seminar of week 1 on a first-come-first-serve basis. Any absent students are randomly assigned to groups and weeks to fill the remaining spots.\n\nSeminar 1Seminar 2\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching week\nPresenters\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n2\nNo presentation\n\n\n\n3\nGrant, Alexa\nCJEU, SA SC\n\n\n4\nJack, Sofia\nUK SC, ICC\n\n\n5\nCharles, Matthieu\nFR CC, ECtHR\n\n\n6\nRebecca, Ariane, Sophie\nIT SC, BR SC,\n\n\n7\nIva, Vishal\nCA SC, PL SC\n\n\n8\nManya, Young Seo, Crystal\nIN SC, IACtHR , JP SC\n\n\n9\nMax, Ben, Kohen\nMX SC, , KR SC\n\n\n10\nJoss, Maude\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching week\nPresenters\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n2\nNo presentation\n\n\n\n3\nDavid, Chiharu\nDE SC, JP SC\n\n\n4\nKamile, Liz\nUS SC, ICJ\n\n\n5\nZoya, Gabriele\n,\n\n\n6\nNatania, Corey\n, SA CC\n\n\n7\nTiegan, Sam\n, CA SC\n\n\n8\nJoey, Sophie\nKR SC, AU SC\n\n\n9\nCarla, Chloe\n, Cour d’assises\n\n\n10\nSacha,\nFR CC,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach court can only be covered once in a presentation.

Supplementary analyses – such as robustness checks – or evidence which would take up too much space in the paper – such as a long excerpt from a document – can be submitted in an appendix and referred to in the main text. The appendix does not count towards the 3000-word limit. All essential information must be included in the paper, however.",

In the text, Suen-nada and Ennum-Ashur accuse each other of stealing the valuable contents of a private archive which they both claim to own. Items within the archive include cylinder seals, tablets belonging to various named merchants, and tablets belonging to strangers that were deposited there for safe keeping. As undisturbed tablet storerooms are extremely rare, this text is important for reconstructing the contents of a sealed archive. Ennum-Assur calls for the case to be moved to Ashur to be tried in front of the city assembly and king, but unfortunately the verdict of the court is unknown."

Found in some countries as late as the 19th century\ntrial by ordeal: the accused was subjected to an (extremely) unpleasant experience to establish their innocence/guilt. Abolished in England after 1219\ntrial by combat: the winner of the fight was presumed to be legally “right”\n\nPeter Leeson makes the argument that ordeals were actually effective judicial tools\n\n\nthe guilty knew they would not pass the ordeal -&gt; admitted guilt\nthe innocent expected God to intervene (eg not be burned by boiling water) -&gt; took the ordeal\nthe ordeal was gamed by priests, so that many of those taking it would pass. The issue with the argument is that the priest was the de facto judge by choosing whether to make water hot or cold and subsequently evaluating the injury"
